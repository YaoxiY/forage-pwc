### Overall Agent Performance
Dan stands out in terms of both the number of calls answered and resolved, and has a high customer satisfaction rating, possibly making him the top-performing agent.  
Stewart has the fewest calls answered and resolved, and further analysis may be needed to understand the reasons.
